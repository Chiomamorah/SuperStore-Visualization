## INTRODUCTION
This is the project I worked on in my data analytics bootcamp. As someone who is passionate about working with mathematical data and pattern recognition, working on this project has been fulfilling and inspiring. This Super Store Analysis Project that gave me insightful ideas on how best this organisation can leverage their customer base, product categories and states to generate more profit

## SKILLS DEMONSTRATED
Some PowerBI skills like DAX, Modelling and filters

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
1. Identify the top selling product category.
2. Identify the most profitable region.
3. Identify the State or Province that generates the most revenue.
4. Identify the product with the most profit.
5. Identify the sales and trends from Year 2010 to year 2013.

## DATA ANALYSIS AND VISUALIZATION.
1. I analyzed the sales fact data and the product category data to identify the top selling product category. This is based on the sales revenue. I used the funnel chart and donut chart to visualize this data.
2. I used the donut chart for the visualization and analyzed this data using the sales fact table, region and sales data.
3. I used the bar chart for this visualisation while analysing the sales fact table, state/province data, and sales data.
4. I used the clustered column chart to visualize the product with the most profit.
5. From the Line chart that was visualized, it can be deducted that the sales revenue of the Store was at its peak in January 2013.
